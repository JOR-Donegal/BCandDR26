# Finally
I am very critical of most standards bodies. In many cases they appear like a paper mill over necessary waffle! Some of the relevant standards for this section include;

| Standard / Framework | Focus Area                        |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| ISO/IEC 27001        | Secure backup & recovery controls |
| ISO 22301            | Business continuity & resilience  |
| NIST SP 800-34       | Disaster recovery planning        |
| NIST SP 800-53       | Security & recovery controls      |
| ITIL                 | IT service continuity             |
| COBIT                | Governance & control objectives   |
